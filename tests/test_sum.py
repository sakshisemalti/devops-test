  The provided code has no bugs or issues that need to be fixed. The `assert` statement is used to check that the result of calling the `add` function with arguments `2` and `3` is equal to `5`, which it is, so the test passes.

However, if you wanted to add some additional tests to the `test_add` function, you could do so by adding more `assert` statements or using a different testing framework that allows for more complex testing scenarios.
